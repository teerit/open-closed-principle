# The SOLID design principles
## Open Closed Principle

It is recommended that the developers should follow SOLID principle when writing code. One of the five 
of SOLID principle is the open/closed principle. It is states that software entities like class, modules, etc.; 
should be able to extend a class behavior without modifying it. This principle separates the existing code from 
modified mode to provide better stability, maintainability and minimizes the changes in the code.

## Single Responsibility Principle
This principle states that each class should have one responsibility, one single purpose. This means that a class
will do only one job, which leads to conclude it should have only one reason to change.
